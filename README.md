# Barbershop Website

Welcome to The Barbershop website where style meets convenience.

## Brief Description

The Barbershop website is a modern and minimalistic website designed to provide convenient access to our valued customers. This is achieved by providing access to the best barbers in the area of the customer, in the comfort of the customer's home, at the availability of the customer. Gone are the days where you have to sacrifice a Saturday morning to receive your grooming services. All you do is click a button, and the rest is organised for you!

### Key Selling Points

## Technology Stack Used
The following programming languages and modules have been used to complete the project:

* HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for Design
* Python for Statistics Page (Specifically Plotly, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib)
* Ionic Icons for Icons
* Trello for Planning and Ideation


## Additional Notes
While the tech stack used is extensive, only the HTML and CSS elements of the application have been compiled. There will be further improvements added to the application with additional programming languages such as JavaScript and its frameworks for increased interactivity and responsiveness. This may also entail components of machine and deep learning once the Python aspects (data and visualisations) have been added to the application. 

Contributions to the application are welcome. This is only a project to demonstrate my front-end development skills, therefore, collaborations with other developers will only help me improve my skills. Feedback is always welcome!
